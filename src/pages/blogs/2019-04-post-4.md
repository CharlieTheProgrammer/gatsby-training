# Testing Title
I've been using Vue for some time now and this past weekend, I decided to take a look at React. It taught me a few new things.

This is my fourth **blog** post in Gatsby.

So far I've figure out how to do the following:
* Use *Markdown* to preview stuff in **VS Code**
* Link images within Markdown to GraphQL using *gatsy-transformer-remark* and *gatsy-remark-images*. These images will appear in the production build.
